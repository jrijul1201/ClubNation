# About the Project
We plan on building portals for club members as well as coordinators. Events/sessions/competitions can be planned, declared, organized, and conducted smoothly using this platform. Coordinators will have the privilege to add, edit, and delete events/sessions regularly. Coordinators can also add other coordinators/core team members of the club to the team page. We are also planning to add discussion forums, and an events and session ideas requests panel. Students/Club members will log in to their portal and find all the information regarding upcoming, ongoing, and past events and sessions.
